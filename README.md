# Universal_App_Template
UI Templates and toolkits for building web-based applications which are based on RESTful style APIs

Here is my final project for the course **Mobile Internet Technology**.
Based on the **iOS** platform, I am working on an universal application, which can generate the major 
components and user interface for web-based applications. And those websites are required to open
***RESTful*** APIs.

For more information about **REST**, please refer to:

The alpha version of the application fits in with the APIs from **豆瓣**, please refer to:
